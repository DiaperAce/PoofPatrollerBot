# PoofPatrollerBot
Repository for @PoofPatrollerBot on Telegram

# Under The Hood
This work uses the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api), and the [python-telegram package](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot). The basic command is /check, which has they syntax:
  ```
  /check @username
  ```
The code works to generate a pseudo random number between 1 and 6 (basically rolling a die), and then assigning a status based on that number and reporting it back to the user
